          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The theme of the challenge that led to the creation of this title is
            Haunted House. Sincerely, not every member of the team was aware of
            this. We were spontaneous, and our idea, in the end, leaned towards
            the theme. Interesting enough, it started from musing about Home
            Alone, and here we are with the title:{" "}
            <span>The Chronicles of Amusor (COA)</span>, a game about the
            horrific experience of a student at his family house for the
            Christmas holiday.

          <h3>Story Overview</h3>
          <p>
            It was near the end of the semester, and all students planned to
            travel for the Christmas break. It was definitely a cold December,
            but a rewarding one, as Orti had envisaged. He would go to his
            family house in Gilbor, a small town in Budapest. All roads lead to
            Amusor Mansion, as all family members popularly call it. It is
            customary for everyone to make themselves available for not just the
            festivities but also to reunite the family bond. By the time Orti
            arrived, on entering the Amusor mansion, nothing was normal; nobody
            was there, it seemed like everybody was gone. Now he needs to figure
            out why, traverse the big ancient villa, battle the familiar spirit,
            and put an end to the cause of this horrendous happening.
          </p>

        <div className="prot_three_c_eight">
          <h3>Ending</h3>
          <p>
            Orti discovered the underground dungeon key, and now he needs to
            burn the corpse, which has been the cause of the enchantment and
            haunting in the house. Through this, he restored peace to Amusor and
            brought back the family members.

          <h3>Interface</h3>
          <p>
            Visual Design: Our design style aims towards high fidelity. The
            design decision we made balances the use of premade assets from Epic
            store and custom made assets by our team, obviously, we needed to
            work with speed and not sacrifice quality. Here are some screenshots
            from the game:

          <p>
            Our aim is to not derail from the dark theme, hence we choose spooky
            sound effects.

          <h3>Level design</h3>
          <p>
            The whole game is happening in a house, hence we thought to design
            each floor as a level on its own, with different tasks to be
            accomplished on each floor. The design forces the player to interact
            with all floors and in fact subtly merry-go-round.
